# Longitudinal Autopilot Controller for Fixed-Wing UAV

This project involves the design and evaluation of a longitudinal autopilot for a fixed-wing UAV using MATLAB/Simulink. Key aspects include:

- **PID Controllers**: Designed and tuned for course stability and altitude control.
- **State Space Model**: Developed from aerodynamic parameters for accurate UAV dynamics.
- **Flight Management System**: Manages controller transitions across flight phases.
- **Simulation & Validation**: Extensive testing to ensure performance and stability.

**Demonstrations:**
